- **Student Projects:**

As a further esteem indicator, my MSc students' projects have won, on multiple occasions, best [MSc project awards and the RHUL David Lindsay Prizes](https://intranet.royalholloway.ac.uk/isg/informationfornewreturningstudents/mscproject/thesisprizes.aspx); some of these have also resulted in conference publications, with best paper and session awards.

- **Vulnerability Identification**

<mark> THIS IS EMPTY </mark>

- **Android OS Vulnerability, 2021**
Along with Dr Carlton Shepherd, we discovered a vulnerability in the Android OS. It was responsibly disclosed to the affected organisation and it was formally acknowledged. The issue affects all known Android versions, across all manufacturers. The findings were also disseminated to our Horizon 2020 (EXFILES) project partners, and an academic paper on this topic is currently under review.

- **Automated Fuzzing Framework for IoT Devices, 2020.**
I supervised an MSc project on the development of "Building an Automated Fuzzing Framework for IoT Devices". The project results demonstrated that the framework can emulate random firmware devices, and identified seven memory corruption exploits that include two zero-day vulnerabilities.

- **DVR, 2018:**
One of my MSc supervisees discovered a previously unknown buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific DVR. The [vulnerability](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-10088/) (CVE ID: CVE-2018-10088) has since been given a CVSS score of 10.0, which is the highest any vulnerability can score.

- [**Fair and Transparent Blockchain based Tendering Framework - A Step Towards Open Governance**](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/fair-and-transparent-blockchain-based-tendering-framework--a-step-towards-open-governance(35604283-ea50-476e-8ecc-cbd5fdb9cd7a).html)**, 2018**.
This paper was reported in the [Medium Platform](https://medium.com/wethinkideas/a-practical-application-of-blockchain-in-open-governance-85ecad48585e), and it was subsequently identified by a group in the World Economic Forum that was running a project on increasing transparency in government procurement using blockchain and smart contracts. Many of the technical objectives of the project were identified and met by our paper.
