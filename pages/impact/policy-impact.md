I have led various teams of information security consultants working on a number of high profile consultancy projects

### Expert advisory and research work for the UK Cards Association.

Official press release 26/11/2014

*"The Information Security Group (ISG) at Royal Holloway, University of London has been carrying out a sequence of expert studies on payment authentication for the UK Cards Association. The association is the trade body for the card payments industry in the UK, representing financial institutions that act as card issuers and acquirers; and is also one of the sponsoring members of the ISG Smart Card Centre.*

*The studies have addressed attacks and countermeasures for current chip & PIN cards and the evolution of security protocols and technologies that will impact how we will all pay for things in future. The work has been led by Konstantinos Markantonakis and the ISG expert team included Professor Keith Martin, Professor Keith Mayes, Professor Fred Piper and Dr Geraint Price."*

### Expert advisory work for smart card ticketing system.

I was a member of the expert ISG team on a consultancy project related to public transport. This work was published and presented at high office level; it involved quantifying the extent of the security problems, advising on short-term remedial measures, formally reviewing plans for migration to new technologies, and advising if and when legacy paper tickets could be withdrawn.

### Evaluation of Security Controllers in Mobile Devices

I have co-authored an evaluation paper addressing different options for security controllers to exist in mobile devices. The document was forwarded to the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as an internal document, and it was distributed amongst the main Telco operators of the world. An early version can be found [here](http://www.crisptelecom.com/files/simuc.pdf).

### User Centric Smart Card Ownership Model

While the smart card industry players are addressing the issues related to the control of the smart card in a Trusted Service Management based architecture, we proposed an alternative solution, which gives the control of the smart card to its user. Our proposal, referred to as User Centric Smart Card (UCSC), and initially put forward in 2009, advocates for an open, secure, trusted and reliable environment that services the primary concern: the consumer. In addition, our work on the UCSC also led to proposing a Trusted Platform Module for Smart Cards and embedded devices.
