# Patents

### 2021

We have submitted, through RHUL and Research and Innovation, a patent related to secure data exchanges for our Tensorcrypt Commercialisation project.Â 

### 2019

I worked with a team of SCC experts towards the creation of a worldwide patent application as a "Technique to record an event and its impact on the data during the lifetime of a data -- specific to individual entities represented in the data." The implementation helps in serving General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rights: Right to Access, Right to Forget, and Right to Rectification (with evidence).
