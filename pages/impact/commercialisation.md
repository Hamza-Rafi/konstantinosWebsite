- "TensorCrypt", Innovate UK (Commercialisation), CyberASAP, 15/04/2021-15/02/2022
This project utilises Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) for confidential data exchanges.
We participated in the CyberAsap 2021 programme and our project was amongst the finalist of the competition. We received funding to develop our Minimal Viable Product (MVP). We interviewed and hired four RHUL UG student developers (hired until Feb 2022) to help us develop the MVP. We have also submitted, with support from our RHUL Research and Innovation colleagues, a patent application related to the unique selling point of TensorCrypt.Â

Explainable AI ("Seclea").Seclea is a deep tech spin-out from the Smart card and IoT Security Centre (SCC) at Royal Holloway, University of London that has a patentable novel technology to make machine learning and deep learning algorithms explainable, auditable and transparent. The company was also supported by the Icure programme and received funding from external investors and Innovate UK.

Threat Detection through causality chains ("PrineSec"). A further spin-off effort with patentable technology on "creating causality chains to empower predictive threat detection" (PrineSec). Our project was submitted in the 3rd CyberASAP Innovate; it was amongst the finalists and received funding to develop Minimal Viable Product (MVP). I lead a team of developers and technical team members, developing our MVP product under funding from Innovate UK. The project was successfully completed in Feb 2020. RHUL has invested in further business analysis around the commercialisation opportunities of the technique developed at SCC. Furthermore, RHUL has also invested in building a commercial grade implementation of an MVP, in order to provide the steppingstone for commercialising the aforementioned patent. I am currently exploring collaboration opportunities to lead the PrineSec project into its next commercialisation step.
