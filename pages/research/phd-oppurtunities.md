# PhD Opportunities
---

I am constantly seeking strong candidates with a background in computer science, information security, electronic engineering or computer engineering (knowledge of cryptography is desirable, but not essential) to join my team of PhD students. I am particularly interested in supervising high calibre PhD candidates to work in the following areas:

-   Secure Application Execution
-   Trusted Execution Environments
-   Avionics and Drone Security
-   Automotive Security
-   Secure Firmware Updates
-   Industrial Control Systems
-   Video/Computer Game Anti-cheating Mechanisms
-   Data Provenance
-   Blockchain technologies for transport, payment, healthcare and IoTs
-   Fault Attacks for Virtual Machines in Embedded Platforms
-   Mobile Devices and Platform security
-   E-Voting
-   Digital Health
-   Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
-   Processor and Micro-controller Security
-   Embedded Device Security
-   Security and Privacy Issues in Crowd based Cloud Computing
-   Security and Trust for Swarm Intelligence Architectures
-   Gait Based Authentication for Mobile Devices
-   Financial Systems, Payment Cards, Blockchain Technologies
-   Cyber Physical Systems for Security Critical Services

**PhD Funding**

[**Royal Holloway Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security**](http://www.rhul.ac.uk/isg/cybersecuritycdt/home.aspx)

Funding for PhD students is available through the [Royal Holloway Centre for Doctoral Training in Cyber Security](http://www.rhul.ac.uk/isg/cybersecuritycdt/home.aspx). For a proposed PhD topic (feel free to suggest alternatives) please follow this link: <http://www.findaphd.com/search/projectDetails.aspx?PJID=44472>. The ideal candidate should have proficient practical skills (such as experience in software development), and good communication and team working skills. A strong interest in information security problems that aim to bridge theory and practice in embedded systems, IoTs, trusted execution environments, mobile devices, smart cards and RFIDs is desirable.

**SCC Funding**

Additional funding maybe available through the SCC sponsors. If you have a 2.1 or a first-class BSc degree and/or a MSc with distinction in computer science, information security or electronic/computer engineering, and you are interested in one of the above research topics, please do get in touch.

**Self-Funded**

I will be happy to consider self-funded/sponsored PhD opportunities.

**Internships**

Please note that currently we have no funding for internships. I will be happy to discuss self-funded internship opportunities on specific, mutually agreed and well-defined research topics.
