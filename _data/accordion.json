We have also been conducting research in the field of bitcoins and fair exchange protocols [CP81], and exploring the benefits of block chain technologies for other applications. I also have a keen interest in the field of centralised payment systems [CP89]; this research thread has resulted into numerous research questions [CP95] [CP79], where we practically examine the efficient use of mobile phone sensors for avoiding relay attacks [CP81]."

The main aim of this research thread [CP77, CP87, CP94] is to detect potential attacks, protect runtime data, and provide verified instruction interpretation and control flow verification, in an attempt to recover the underlying platform in a secure state. The practicality of these proposals has been implemented and tested on an FPGA platform, implementing a microprocessor."

This includes preventing attacks by identifying any vulnerabilities or modifications (at the software level) of the underlying platform. This research thread also examines the security provisions of a number of trusted execution environments, such as ARM TrustZone and Intel SGX, in order to provide security enhancements [CCP105, CPP114, CP122, CP130]."

We have examined existing industrial proposals (e.g. the EVITA project) and, based on our analysis, we have proposed a number of improved protocols, related to safety and security measures; these are implemented in commercial Electronic Control Units (ECUs), and they are analysed using mechanical tools, such as CasperFDR and Scyther [CP111]."

In essence, the attacker is able to read the contents of different memories and, as a result, any protection based on the tamper-resistant abilities of the chip, such as secure storage of cryptographic keys, will be rendered useless. We are proposing a model, consisting of different hardware intrinsic functions [CP98], that will allow the binding of software to a specific hardware, not only for IP protection, but also for protection against counterfeit, reused and repackaged products."
