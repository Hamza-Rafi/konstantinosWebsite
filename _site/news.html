<h3 id="real-world-impact">Real World Impact</h3>

<p>The Smart Card and IoT Security Centre (SCC) team published a paper on “<a href="https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/fair-and-transparent-blockchain-based-tendering-framework--a-step-towards-open-governance(35604283-ea50-476e-8ecc-cbd5fdb9cd7a).html">Fair and Transparent Blockchain based Tendering Framework - A Step Towards Open Governance</a>”. The World Economic Forum (WEF), independently of the ISG-SCC, conceived a project to develop an open government procurement system by designing a system that provides transparency to the tendering frameworks and enables an open/fair auditing mechanism on the blockchain. The SCC team was approached and acknowledged about their significant contribution, through our paper, towards similar project goals. The significance societal impact of the work is also reported in (<a href="https://rb.gy/oixpwk">https://rb.gy/oixpwk</a>).

<h3 id="patent-and-commercialization">Patent and commercialization</h3>

<p>Prof Konstantinos Markantonakis, Dr Raja Naeem Akram and Mr James Tapsell, worked successfully into the creation of a patent as a “Technique to record an event and its impact on the data during the lifetime of a data – specific to individual entities represented in the data.” The implementation helps in serving General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rights: Right to Access, Right to Forget, and Right to Rectification (with evidence). <br /><br /> RHUL has invested in further business analysis around the commercialisation opportunities of the technique developed at SCC. Furthermore, it has invested in building a commercial grade implementation of an MVP, in order to provide the stepping stone for commercialising the aforementioned patent.
